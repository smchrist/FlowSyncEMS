# FlowSyncEMS

FlowSyncEMS is an open-source tool designed to assist EMS personnel in managing IV drips, medication dosing, and patient workflows in the absence of advanced medical devices like IV pumps. By leveraging intuitive design and preset protocols, FlowSyncEMS aims to simplify field-based medication administration, enhance accuracy, and reduce the cognitive load during high-pressure situations.
